INTRODUCTION:................................................................

                            Detection and recognition of plant diseases using machine 
learning are very efficient in providing symptoms of identifying diseases at its earliest. 
Plant pathologists can analyze the digital images using digital image processing for 
diagnosis of plant diseases. Application of computer vision and image processing 
strategies simply assist farmers in all of the regions of agriculture. Generally, the plant 
diseases are caused by the abnormal physiological functionalities of plants.

FUTURE SCOPE:………………………………………………..

* The technology will assist farmers by providing required advice on crops, their 
growth, and other basic information.

*The device can also help farmers calculate crop MSP.
